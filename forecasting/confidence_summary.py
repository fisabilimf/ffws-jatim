âœ… FORECASTING WITH EXISTING DATA: SUCCESSFUL
The system is now successfully forecasting using the existing historical data:
â€¢ 13,440 historical records (7 days Ã— 20 sensors Ã— 15-min intervals)
â€¢ Multi-feature time series input (3-4 lag values)
â€¢ TensorFlow compatibility issues resolved
â€¢ Input/output shape mismatches fixed

âœ… CONFIDENCE SCORING: IMPLEMENTED & WORKING
A comprehensive confidence scoring system has been implemented that considers:

ðŸ“Š CONFIDENCE COMPONENTS (100% = 1.0):
   â€¢ Data Quality (25%): Input completeness & outlier detection
   â€¢ Model Consistency (20%): Smoothness of predictions over time
   â€¢ Historical Accuracy (25%): Past model performance analysis
   â€¢ Input Stability (15%): Variance in input features over time
   â€¢ Prediction Variance (15%): Consistency of model outputs

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
   â€¢ Fixed TensorFlow version compatibility (2.19.0 vs 2.14.0-2.15.0 models)
   â€¢ Resolved input shape formatting for sequence models (1, 5, n_features)
   â€¢ Fixed output scaling for different model architectures
   â€¢ Implemented multi-component confidence calculation
   â€¢ Enhanced database prediction storage with confidence scores

ðŸ’¾ DATABASE INTEGRATION:
   â€¢ Confidence scores are stored in data_predictions.confidence_score
   â€¢ API endpoints return confidence information
   â€¢ Historical accuracy uses past prediction performance

ðŸŽ¨ CONFIDENCE INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
   ðŸŸ¢ 0.80-1.00: HIGH confidence - Predictions highly reliable
   ðŸŸ¡ 0.60-0.79: MEDIUM confidence - Reasonably reliable  
   ðŸŸ  0.40-0.59: LOW confidence - Use with caution
   ðŸ”´ 0.00-0.39: VERY LOW confidence - Unreliable predictions

ðŸ“š IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   â€¢ ConfidenceScorer class with weighted components
   â€¢ Real-time calculation during prediction
   â€¢ Historical accuracy analysis from database
   â€¢ Input stability and prediction variance metrics
   â€¢ Fallback handling for insufficient data

ðŸŽŠ NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT:
   1. Connect to real-time sensor feeds
   2. Set up automated forecast scheduling
   3. Integrate with frontend dashboard
   4. Configure confidence-based alert thresholds
   5. Implement model retraining workflows

The FFWS forecasting system now provides reliable predictions with quantified
confidence levels, enabling better decision-making for flood warnings!
